I. INTRODUCTION 
Understanding various parameters of a country’s economy plays a pivotal role in shaping future decisions and policies. Key metrics such as Change in GDP [GDP Growth], Population Dynamics and other economic keys can help in shaping future decisions which drive development. This report focuses on gaining insights on the available data on several metrics/parameters of the Indian economy. 

II. Data Processing and EDA
Profile reports were created using Pandas-Profiling module [ Now renamed to ydt-profiling]. An HTML profile report was built using the aforementioned module and the results were used for EDA.

I.	The Population Growth rate is on a constant decline since the 1980s.  
II.	There seems to be an unsual reduction in population growth rate from 1964 to 1967, which can be attributed to various factors like Post-sterlization effects, Natural Disasters [Bihar Famines], effect of Family Planning Programmes, etc.   
III.	The Population Growth rate has been constantly declining at a rate of -0.0369, Which means it would take 27 more years for the population to start declining [2047], assuming same mortality and emigration rates.  
IV.	Assuming a Constant decline rate of -0.0369, the following table for population can be derived :

V.	
 

Assuming constant decline rates, the popluation of India will peak in the year 2047, and then start to gradually decline. But, such situations may be very unlikely to occur, as the government may be very swift in promoting policies to increase population growth.
Hence a Sigmoid Curve would be a reasonable population estimate.

2.IMPORT & EXPORT OVER THE YEARS 
I.	The average Import ratio [vs GDP] stood at an average of 12.75% while the average Export Ratio [vs GDP] stood at an average of 10.89% over the years.
II.	The share of Imports as a part of GDP has tripled on an average. The average rates of Import before 2000 were 7.51%, whilst after 2000 it stood at an average of 22.73%, showing an increase of 3.02%.
III.	Similarly, the export ratio has also tripled from 6.26 to 19.70 [ before and after 2000s respectively]
3 .GDP & GDP GROWTH RATE TRENDS
 
I.	A Quick observation shows that the GDP growth rates have sharply fallen during the times of Economic Crisis, usually triggered by External Factors like War & Pandemics. 
II.	A fall of GDP growth rate to -2.6 in 1965 was a direct consequence of Indo-Pak War.
III.	It can be seen that the Indo-Pak war had a greated effect on GDP growth than the Indo-China war in 1962, which did result in a shorted dip of Prices. The GDP growth rate was still in negatives in 1966. 
IV.	Another sharp decrease since 1971 is a direct consequence of India-Pak war.
V.	The sharp decline in 1979 was due to both internal and external factors. With severe drought gripping most of the country and crude oil prices almost doubling due to supply disruptions because of the Iranian revolution against the state’s monarch. After two remarkable years of good rainfall, the drought in the kharif season in the grain producing states of the country led to decline in agricultural production by 10%. The sharp rise in petroleum prices also led to flare up of inflationary pressure with wholesale price inflation soaring 20%.
VI.	The most notable fall was during Covid-19, where GDP growth stood at -7.25
 

4. LIFE EXPECTANCY  
The average Life expectnacy shown a decent increase since 1960s. The decadal Life Expectancy change is given as follows: 

Year		CLE
1960-1970	5.62
1970-1980	5.58
1980-1990	3.71
1990-2000	3.73
2000-2010	3.29
2010-2020	2.63

Overall, the life expectancy has increased by 24 years since 1960s

5. FORMULATING SCENARIOS
In the previous section, we had discussed the population dynamics. Since population of a country can be subject to frequent population shocks along with various parameters [Like Birth & Death Rates, Immigration and Emigration] driving the total population with unpredictable variability, it is important to simulate a wide variety of scenarios to sit down with the best estimate. 

6.INFLATION
 
The average Inflation rate stands at 7.41% across the years. In this, the average Yearly inflation stands at 6.41% for 2000-2010 and 6.256% for 2011-2020. 

7.GDP [$]

 

GDP has been steadily increasing over the years. Even during times of Recession in 2008, only a small dip was seen. Covid-19 had a devastating impact on GDP in 2020, much greater than the 2008 reccession as the dip in GDP($) was far more downwards than that in 2008.

SUMMARY:
Thus, the Indian Economy and related parameters were analyzed for the years between 1960 and 2020.
