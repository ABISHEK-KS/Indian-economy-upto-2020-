I. INTRODUCTION 
Understanding various parameters of a countryâ€™s economy plays a pivotal role in shaping future decisions and policies. Key metrics such as Change in GDP [GDP Growth], Population Dynamics and other economic keys can help in shaping future decisions which drive development. This report focuses on gaining insights on the available data on several metrics/parameters of the Indian economy. 

II. Data Processing and EDA
Profile reports were created using Pandas-Profiling module [ Now renamed to ydt-profiling]. An HTML profile report was built using the aforementioned module and the results were used for EDA.

I.	The Population Growth rate is on a constant decline since the 1980s.  
II.	There seems to be an unsual reduction in population growth rate from 1964 to 1967, which can be attributed to various factors like Post-sterlization effects, Natural Disasters [Bihar Famines], effect of Family Planning Programmes, etc.   
III.	The Population Growth rate has been constantly declining at a rate of -0.0369, Which means it would take 27 more years for the population to start declining [2047], assuming same mortality and emigration rates.  
IV.	Assuming a Constant decline rate of -0.0369, the following table for population can be derived :
